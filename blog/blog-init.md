I've found myself captivated by the sheer magnitude of knowledge that books, experiences, colleagues, professors, and more have given me. In addition, since grade school I've keenly enjoyed the art of writing, which has allowed me to document, express, convey and create.

At the time of writing this, being 23 years old, I find myself entering a new stage in my life where I've begun working as a Software Engineer at Amazon (as of today it's been 3 months), in addition to also doing my Master's of Engineering at the illustrious and world renowned venue of University of Toronto (St. George). Throughout these months I've seen myself growing a lot, whether it be in terms of technical skill, career advancement, broadening my network's horizons, and much more.

As a result, I've decided to embark on this journey into the "Blogosphere" and let this platform serve as a place where I can document my learnings, achievements, tutorials, or blurb interesting thoughts on to a page. My hope is that through this platform I can not only provide benefit to the technical communities that my work might involve, but a place where I can document my journey and findings.


And so, let the journey of a thousand steps start with this one.
